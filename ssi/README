Instructions for RTEMS SSI Encoder Readback          Last Updated 11/02/2007
-------------------------------------------

I - Adding the ssi package to your IOC application:
-----------------------------------------------------

(1) Add SSI to configure/RELEASE and clean/rebuild configure.

(2) Link ssi library into the app by adding to xxxApp/src/Makefile:

   xxx_LIBS += ssi

(3) Add the following .dbd files to xxxApp/src/Makefile 
    or to xxxApp/src/xxxInclude.dbd:

   xxx_DBD += SSI.dbd

(4) When creating ai records for the encoder readback, conversion
    to engineering units can be done by setting LINR=LINEAR and EGUF/EGUL to
    the high range and low range engineering units values. 


II - Adding SSI configuration to your IOC startup file:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Add SSIConfigure for each EVR (before iocInit).

    SSIConfigure(<card>,<address>,<model>,<numbits>,<numchans>,<format>)

    where card     = card number, starting from 0, incrementing by 1
                     for each subsequent card
    and   address  = VME card base address on 0x20000 boundary
    and   model    = 0x505F or 0x552
    and   numbits  = 1 to 32 bits for 505F, 24 for 552
    and   numchans = 1 to 5 for 505F, 1 to 32 for 552
    and   format   = 0 = binary, 1 = gray (505F only)


III - Hardware Setup:
---------------------

(1) Set dip switches so that card is A24 (standard).  Note that the default 
    is A32 (extended)).  Also set base address dip switches per instructions
    in the manual:
    http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~spear/epics/vme/ECM_505F.pdf

IV - Test Database and Display:
--------------------------------

(1) ssi/ssiApp/Db/ssiAi.db and ssiAi.template provide a test database with
    32 ai records.  For testing, add the following to the startup file:

    dbLoadTemplate("db/ssiAi.template")

(2) ssi/ssiApp/medm/ssiAis.edl is a test display to use with the above
    template:

    edm -x -eolc -m "SSI=SSI" <location of ssi>/ssiApp/medm/ssiAis.edl &
