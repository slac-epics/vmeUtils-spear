To build this module you must first create a RELEASE_SITE
file. The RELEASE_SITE file should define the path to the
top of your EPICS tree at your site.

Example file looks like so:
===============================================================

#RELEASE Location of external products
# Run "gnumake clean uninstall install" in the application
# top directory each time this file is changed.

# =============================================================
# Define the top of the EPICS tree for your site.
# We will build some tools/scripts that allow us to
# change this easily when relocating software.
# ==============================================================
EPICS_SITE_TOP=/usr/local/lcls/epics

================================================================
